    "UK Government has a certain checklist for the content writers. They want the content writers to be more specific in the details they want to convey to the users. UK Government basically believes that when you write more people understand less. So they came up with a simple solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There can be no more than 15 Sentences.\n",
    "2. And each sentence should have less than 15 words.\n",
    "3. And each word should be less than 15 letters.\n",

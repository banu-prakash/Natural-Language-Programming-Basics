    "Chunk extraction is a useful preliminary step to information extraction, that creates parse trees from unstructured text with a chunker. Once you have a parse tree of a sentence, you can do more specific information extraction, such as named entity recognition and relation extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the chunk structure for a given sentence, the RegexpParser chunker begins with a flat structure in which no tokens are chunked. The chunking rules are applied in turn, successively updating the chunk structure. Once all of the rules have been invoked, the resulting chunk structure is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommended Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sentence tokenization of the text.\n",
    "2. Word tokenization.\n",
    "3. POS tagging.\n",
    "4. Run the chunk rule. \n"

    "Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, Gauteng, South Africa,[27] the son of Maye Musk (née Haldeman), a model and dietician from Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada;[28] and Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot and sailor. He has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974).[28][29][30][31] His paternal grandmother was British, and he also has Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry,[32][33] and his maternal grandfather was American, from Minnesota.[34] After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk lived mostly with his father in the suburbs of Pretoria.[32]\n",

    "At What age did Musk got interested in computing? At age 10, he developed an interest in computing with the Commodore VIC-20.[36] He taught himself computer programming at the age of 12, sold the code for a BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar, to a magazine called PC and Office Technology, for approximately $500. [37][38] A web version of the game is available online.[37][39]\n",

Therefore, with the law change, he is considered to have always been a Canadian citizen by birth.\n",
